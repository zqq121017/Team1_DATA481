## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
raw_data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/superbowl-ads/main/superbowl-ads.csv")
head(raw_data)
```
```{r}
mean(raw_data$`funny` == TRUE, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(raw_data$`patriotic` == TRUE, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(raw_data$`use_sex` == TRUE, na.rm = TRUE)

tab <- table(raw_data$brand)
mode_brand <- names(tab)[which.max(tab)]
mode_freq  <- max(tab)
mode_brand
mode_freq

```
```{r}
props <- data.frame(
  feature = c("funny", "patriotic", "use_sex"),
  proportion = c(
    mean(raw_data$funny, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean(raw_data$patriotic, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean(raw_data$use_sex, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(props, aes(x = feature, y = proportion)) +
  geom_col() +
  ylim(0, 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Proportion of TRUE Values by Feature",
    y = "Proportion",
    x = "Feature"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
